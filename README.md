my code repository
This is the repository created to retrieve tweet data using Twitter APIs.
There are two solutions in this repository.
1.  TwitterSvc.sln   - This is the solution that provides the APIs.
       There are two APIs that are usable:
           https://localhost:7000/api/TweetDatas/   to get the hashtag distribution
           https://localhost:7000/api/TweetDatas/10   to get the 10 most recent tweets sampled
2.  TwitterConsole.sln - This is the console application that calls these two APIs and displays the data on the console window.
